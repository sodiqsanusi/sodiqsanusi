### Hi there 👋🏾
I'm **Sodiq**, a software developer with over 2 years of experience making web applications. <br>
I am currently taking a 12-month Software Engineering course with the African Leadership Group (ALx) to improve my programming skills.

### 🚀 My Passion:
I am passionate about creating solutions that make a difference. Whether it's building fast applications or designing easy-to-use interfaces, I'm fully committed.

### 📚 My Skill Set:
I'm skilled in various technologies, including: <br>
**HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js,** e.t.c - Frontend Development <br>
**Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB,** e.t.c - Backend Development <br>
**Jest, React Testing Library,** e.t.c - Unit Testing <br>
**Redux, Styled Components, Storybook,** e.t.c - Other Tools <br>

I believe in always learning new technologies to stay current in this fast-changing field. My greatest strength still remains my ability to quickly and efficiently learn new tools as I need them.

### 🤖 Hardware & Robotics:
From time to time, I experiment with microcontrollers and hardware components to build fun projects. Using an Arduino Uno or an ESP-32 microcontroller (with MicroPython), I explore the electronics side of tech by following tutorials and IoT roadmaps.

### 🤝🏾 Collaboration and Volunteering:
I'm not just about professional work; I'm also excited about important open source projects. If you have a clear idea of what you want to build and need committed team members, feel free to reach out!
